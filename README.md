Portable Pathogen Detection Device (startfish-avocado)
================

One in six Americans suffer from food-borne diseases every year. One cause of
this is the lack of fast and accurate diagnostic services. P2D2, a cheap, portable, and easy-touse
point-of-care platform for the detection of pathogens based on the presence of DNA in
fluid samples can alleviate this problem. Such a project was made possible through several
innovations: By using the LAMP (loop-mediated isothermal amplification) DNA
amplification process in lieu of PCR (polymerase chain reaction), heating requirements are
simplified as the detection routine is isothermal. A single-use disposable microfluidic cassette
with stored reagents is used as a base on which to run the diagnostic routine on the sample.
Fluid actuation is achieved with a single pump and multiple wax valves. The device leverages
the ubiquity of smartphones by using an application on the user’s phone to connect to the
diagnostic device, execute the test procedure, capture images of the sample, and process the
diagnosis. The device’s heating and lighting systems use low cost components, reducing price
and increasing portability. Overall, the P2D2 provides a cheap, portable, and easy-to-use
mode of diagnosis that has the potential to change the nature of diagnostic health care.
